### Branch Strategy

Are you falling behind? Don't worry, we have you covered. At each stage of the workshop we have provided checkpoints (branches) with the completed code. When you checkout a branch you will have everything you need for the next stage of the workshop.

What is a branch? A branch is an independent snapshot of the code.

```
git checkout <branch-name>
```

**Branches:**

* **step-2** - Project setup completed.
* **step-3** - Routing and view animations completed.
* **step-4** - Containers, components, and styles completed.
* **step-5** - Redux implementation completed.
* **step-6** - Giphy API integration completed.
* **step-7** - Firebase integration completed.
* **completed** - Finished workshop application.
